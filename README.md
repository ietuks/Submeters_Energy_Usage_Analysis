Task 1: Domain Research and Exploratory Data Analysis
Subject: Deep Analytics and Visualization

A deal with a regional home developer to develop analytics for a new set of electrical sub-metering devices used for power management in Smart Homes. Installing these sub-meters could be a big step towards the developer's goal of offering highly efficient Smart Homes that providing owners with power usage analytics.

As a starting point, I was provided with a very large data set that contains 47 months of energy usage data from these devices. My job over the few weeks was be to analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can be created that would empower Smart Home owners with greater understanding and control of their power usage.

Conduct research to become informed on the client’s business.
Identify any analytic skill/knowledge gaps foreseen for the project and plug those gaps with self-learning. With a data set this big (over 4 million observations and 59 attributes), data munging and sub-setting is essential to the analytic process. Working with DateTime and Time Series also needs to be mastered.

Perform an initial exploration of the data. This exploration is used to understand any potential issues, conduct early preprocessing, note summary statistics and identify any early recommendations about improvements to future data collection.

Hold a project kick-off meeting with the client to close the deal. This meeting will center around a presentation that contains all of the project details and our initial exploration of the data.

Initial task is centered around working through the onboarding process and produce a PowerPoint presentation that will be delivered to the home developer’s management team during the kick off meeting. This report will give them confidence in our process and convince them that this project is relevant to their business needs.

I do not know what the data will show, and neither does the home builder; it is my job to tell them how the analysis will be conducted and what they are likely to gain. Hence, its imperative to be precise and accurate with findings and any initial recommendations. Keeping in mind that this will be presented to business rather than technical people.

The future of this project is in my capable hands! Therefore, I have to gather the required resources and prove that the sub-metering devices will deliver the value the developer seeks through data analytics.
