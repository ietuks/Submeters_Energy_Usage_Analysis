Task 1: Domain Research and Exploratory Data Analysis
FROM: Kathy Narim-Nomstrom 
Subject: Deep Analytics and Visualization

Hi,

I have exciting news. We’re about to close a deal with a regional home developer to develop analytics for a new set of electrical sub-metering devices used for power management in Smart Homes. Installing these sub-meters could be a big step towards the developer's goal of offering highly efficient Smart Homes that providing owners with power usage analytics.

As a starting point, they have provided us with a very large data set that contains 47 months of energy usage data from these devices. Our job over the next few weeks will be to analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can be created that would empower Smart Home owners with greater understanding and control of their power usage.

Since you are new at IOT Analytics, I’ll explain our onboarding process for new clients.

Conduct research to become informed on the client’s business. In this case, you will need to get up to speed on the domains of Smart Homes, sub-meters and household power consumption.
Identify any analytic skill/knowledge gaps foreseen for the project and plug those gaps with self-learning. With a data set this big, data munging and sub-setting will be essential to the analytic process. Working with DateTime and Time Series also needs to be mastered.
Perform an initial exploration of the data. This exploration should be used to understand any potential issues, conduct early preprocessing, note summary statistics and identify any early recommendations about improvements to future data collection.
Hold a project kick-off meeting with the client to close the deal. This meeting will center around a presentation that contains all of the project details and our initial exploration of the data.
Your initial task is to work through the onboarding process and produce a PowerPoint presentation that will be delivered to the home developer’s management team during the kick off meeting. This report will give them confidence in our process and convince them that this project is relevant to their business needs.

It is important to remember that we do not know what the data will show, and neither does the home builder; it is your job to tell them how we will conduct the analysis and what they are likely to gain, so be precise and accurate with your findings and any initial recommendations. However, keep in mind that you will be presenting your report to business rather than technical people.

Well, the future of this project is in your capable hands! Gather the required resources and prove that the sub-metering devices will deliver the value the developer seeks through data analytics.

Good luck,

Kathy

VP, IOT Analytics
