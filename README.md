The Background of Project: To develop analytics for new set of electrical sub-metering devices used for power management in Smart Homes for real estate development client. 
Objectives: 1. Determine kind of analytics and visualizations that would empower Smart Home owners with greater understanding and control of their power usage.
Objectives: 2. Consider the clientâ€™s goal, which is to offer highly efficient Smart Homes that provide their customers with power usage analytics.
Submeters Energy Usage Analysis
Visualization and Data Analysis of Sub-meters Electric Power Consumption In A House
Step One: Visualizations with Analysis, consisting of Day, Week and a time period.
Step Two Time Series Visualizations with Analysis, consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3.
Step Three: Linear Regression Forecast Visualizations with Analysis. Consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3. Including the charts built to compare the R2 and RMSE of each model.
Step Four: Decomposition Visualizations with Analysis. Consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3. Including the charts built to compare the summary statistics for the seasonal, trend and random components from each decomposed object.
Step Five: Holt Winters Forecasting and Analysis. Consisting of sub-meters 1, 2 and 3. Each set is composed from the forecast plot and plot containing only the forecasted area.
Correlations or predictions gleaned from the data.
A summary statement that addresses the goal of this project. 
High level business recommendations based on the visualization and analysis of the power consumption data. 
Create a PowerPoint report that will be presented to management team and used to drive decisions about energy usage through analysis and forecasting.
